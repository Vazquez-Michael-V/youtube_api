And how does it fair against carrier-bs?  I have them in most of my late game fleets for a) high engagement range for the XL weapons and b) to kill pesky corvettes , especially torp corvettes.

Mmmm... interesting results right there.

I was wondering how Juggernaut and Titans support would change the outcome.
The auras of those ships could help the battleships a lot, and because of speed reasons, destroyers couldn't have the same support (at least not that easily)

Also having a battleship with maximum engaging range per fleet (carrier combat computer) would change the results?


Keep up with the good work Montu, you are growing at an amazing rate :)

There's a bunch of negatives to these types of destroyers. Getting the needed components may take a long time. Then on the other hand they're significantly easier to replace in both build time and cost. Especially if you have a mega shipyard. You can effectively block out the sun with them.

Still, with the upcoming ship rebalance this will likely completely change again.

And of course the obligatory; "I miss Tachyon Destroyers".

Why did you only test against artillery battleships, when you specifically recommend making 30% of your battleship fleet carriers? Surely something that works against corvettes will work equally well against max evasion destroyers?

An unscreened battleship will always lose. I would like you to repeat this test with similar loadout, but add corvette escort and post a report then.
I would venture a guess that: destroyers will be... destroyed. Corvette escort is much cheaper than your proposed cruiser counter and can be produced much quicker and en-masse.

IMO high evasion destroyers combine very well with Battleships in a mixed fleet or in a two-stack. You sacrifice the speed flexibility, but because the AI usually engages the first ships to close into range with them the destroyers can act as a very effective high evasion screen for your battleships, while still doing damage. Mixed fleets might be non-meta supposedly but I actually think Battleship/Destroyer fleets work great since your Battleships can nullify anti-destroyer ships and vice versa.

Plus if you're fighting a protracted series of fights against a 25x crisis with millions of fleet power, the quick replenishment of the destroyer parts of your fleets can help your fleets get back up to fighting strength before the next millions of fleet power doomstack hits faster than your battleships.

The other option for dealing with high evasion destroyers or corvettes is cloud lightning battleships as they can't miss, and the fact there are no repeatable technologies to increase hull points means that they eventually overtake the design you showed in ability to kill the opponent,  even if their dps is inferior

Hi Montu. Is it a good idea to mix these high evasion destroyers with battleships? Say 40% destroyers and 60% battleships? The idea behind it being that the destroyers screen the battleships, protecting the big expensive ships, while your small destroyers can quickly and easily be reinforced.

I tend to have a set of fleets with identical ship. Mostly battleships and then protect them with a single fleet packed with dozens and dozens of corvettes. If you have a mega shipyard then losing a dozen matters little. This gives the battleships more time to do their thing. Enigmatic decoder is good to add tracking if you have a few of these on the battleships they are quite lethal.

I feel like arc emitters battleships with cloud lightnings is an excellent counter too, but I might be wrong. 
I feel like once a few repeatables get in play it's just as strong if not stronger than the regular neutron launcher set up, and it's exceptionally effective against corvettes that gets killed and destroyers that are pushed to disengage extremely reliably.
But you do need to get the tech, which isn't guaranteed.

Plus I was very lucky with the events that gave me the bonuses. There are like 4-5 in the game. Amoegba study, underwater cruiser, abandoned ship engine and two more I can't remember.

I'd be interested to see crisis-countering techniques at 1x, 5x, and 25x crisis strength.

At the high levels, it seems like mostly my battleships get one-shotted so it doesn't really matter what shields or armour they have. I bet high-evasion destroyers would do really well there on the strategic level.

The problem I have with those designs is that the weapons are kinda awkward. Having the long range weapon weaker against shields and the lower range weapon weaker against armor feels like a huge amount of wasted potential. Since you are going for a lower range build anyway why not go the other way around? (Especially considering how most lategame ships have way more shields than armor.)

Enigma encoder (20%)+combat computer(10%)+excess power(5% max bonus) = 51*1,35 = 68.8
psychic(15%)+gale speed(5%)+amoebas(5%) = 68.8*1,25=86

I like that we have some use for cruisers right now. But it's unfortunate that what sets up in the Rock-Paper-Scissors dynamic is the destroyer player having taken psionic. 

It would be cool if each ascension path had something like that. I suppose the developer's logic is that synthetics scale better late game and so can make up for the combat disadvantage with more economy. But what do you get with biological ascension? Or if you are gestalt? Seems like this would be a good way to both improve ship diversity and give bio ascension a unique role.

Personally, I think this is how destroyers and corvettes should be at a baseline level, so cruisers actually had a role outside of this super niche scenario. Either that or reduce the tracking of neutron launchers and other large weapons. Battleships armed with those large weapons should be relegated to pretty much anti cruiser, battleship and anti station.

I usually go hit and run + trickster with artillery destroyers, they lose fights, however they cause a lot more casualties than they take, especially in the early game where opponents don‚Äôt really have the ability to oneshot them. Also, in your ship design you equipped them with the gauss cannons, what is the reasoning on not going auto cannon, I always thought auto cannons were better, are gauss cannons a more optimal choice?

Montu I've got a question about Neutron launchers since I always see you recommending them. Where they're going to be the first thing firing until the X slots are unlocked, the first thing they're going to be hitting is shields, which they're weak against. Are they really that much better than Kinetic Artillery with their bonus to shield damage, especially considering optimal ship design maxes out shields?

What about mixed compositions with these destroyers, cruisers, and battleships? Could work kind of like a rock-paper-scissors in strategy games, destroyers are good vs battleships, cruisers are good vs destroyers, and battleships are good vs cruisers.

Imagine not having to use single ship type in all your fleets or even a single fleet?

How does this fight look if a 30 BS fleet has 6-8 carriers in it vs these destroyers?  Overall I feel this still becomes a minor element of any major late game fleet composition, with maybe 250-500 fleet power max dedicated to it

so, the big issue I have with this video is the "lets pit a ship designed for destroying large ships against a small ship designed to specifically counter it and see who wins" and claiming that makes the small ship better. unless refitting has changed significantly since the last time I played, if you see the enemy massing destroyers, you don't keep producing anti-capitol battleships, you retrofit them to be anti-destroyer ships, which means going with weapons with a much higher likelihood to hit, and many many more shots, like fighters.

I'm glad that people are realizing a diverse navy is still important, as now Stellaris meta mirrors historical navies.
Just about every WWI-Early WWII navy wanted as many battleships as possible. But torpedo destroyers could sink a battleship on their own despite being so small, so plenty of those are built, as well as cruisers to protect the battleship from said destroyers.

If the other side respecs their battleships to Hangar cores with 2 advanced strikecraft they'll probably delete the destroyers. 

Hybrid carrier battleships with an xl bow and carrier core are my go to lategame ships. Bigger ships die in the alpha strike and stuff that can dodge the spinal mount gets wrecked by the strikecraft.

Less alpha strike than a full artillery loadout, but much mote versatile.

You should try out modded empire at war. It is pretty fun and has a heavy focus on the ship to ship tactics.

If your not running artillery for the evasion destroyers I would argue going for the Kinetic Cannon and a Plasma instead for weapon choice on those Destroyers.
The Kinetic Cannon has better Rate of Fire for better average DPS if it survives especially against shields, and with the evasion computer your engagement range is much closer so Plasma will pay it back for stripping armor and the total hit rate really pays off I think for better kill chances with the evasion keeping them alive longer.

Is it worth building destroyers if you haven't gone psionic? Even at a 50/50 against Battleships I would think the speed advantage would make the destroyers the better choice.
