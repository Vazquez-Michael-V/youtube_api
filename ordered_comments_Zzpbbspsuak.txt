Purchased a new rig recently, just purchased an upgrade that adds DLC to the game.  I've had this on the back burner for awhile as I felt my old system would impinge on a good experience.  Never played before but have seen some game play in the past to warrant the purchase.  Just curious, decided to see what's happening in the future with the game and found your channel.  I'm looking forward to figuring this all out now that I will have more time to devote to the game.   Appreciate your content and think I have the basics down already: genocide to address performance issues and do not use the interdenominational portal.  Sweet! 
(Tippin future me is going to need the content in your channel.....alot)

I was thinking about a spartacus mechanic myself today for slave civilisations acting like an egalitarian great khan. Where a spartacus figure arises within your slave races creating a rebellion. That can spread like a united khanate among your worlds with every victory unless you put it down.

I'd really like to see hull designs get a bit of a rework. As it is, the only variation is what weapons you can place on what ships but I'd be interested in seeing "lighter" hulls that make ships faster/more evasive, "defensive" hulls with more defense slots - things of that nature. Could even tie them to tradition trees so everyone gets a weird mish-mash of hull shapes, make some of the weaker traditions a bit more useful.

As a prolific megacorp player, I’d love a megacorp tree but be absolutely against siphoning or taking control of planets. Megacorps rely on commercial pacts and branch offices. If they could lead to an empire loosing power, then no one would want to associate with megacorps. Sure, it would be an interesting playstyle and I’d be quite interested to test it against AI, but for multiplayer it would significantly hurt megacorps.

I think we need unique tradition influenced weapons and ship techs. Atm everyone uses the same weapons and ship components. Now the current ones are fine as a baseline, but we also need unique branches coming off the core trunk.

Gonna say it: I don't want to see nerfed relics. I don't see any of them consistently enough to think they should be nerfed. I agree some of the Precursors need more love. But that's it. 

Moreover, the Dev team's idea of nerfing relics is generally speaking to make it so rare you never get to see it again. The Grand Herald doesn't even appear anymore in my games. The Blade of the Huntress and Head of Zarquan appear once every 20-25 games at most. It's the recurring theme of Stellaris dev to make something neat show up ubiquitously at launch, and then consign it to oblivion a month later. I'd really prefer rare events be a straight 10% at launch and stay there.

Even if they just give us the SMALLEST changes to ground combat, ill be happy. Multi-stage engagements, the ability to click on certain units and choose targets for them, have buildings active that can be targets with shield effects etc etc. Even just those small things would give us SOMETHING to bite into.

Im all for combat changes. I would love for carriers to be more viable and actually thought if it might be possible to split strike craft into different types like bombers and air (space?) superiority fighters that fill different roles along with a general buff to strike craft, a rework of the carrier computer and potential more hangar slots for carrier sections on battleships (at the cost of other slots ofc, maybe replace the 2 P slots). Also a nerf to neutron launchers wouldn't be the worst thing but i agree that capital ships should still be the main force.

I personally feel like traditions could really use some work. In their current state, there are just too many generically useful or useless modifiers, too many obvious choices, and too many tax options. Prosperity in particular is an obvious best pick for almost every playstyle, but only because it provides that insane finisher and the universally good 5% specialist output. Similarly, traditions like discovery feel as though they would almost never be chosen without their finishers, and trees like supremacy feel necessary on every build except the ultra-pacifist. I think they should work on making more traditions like expansion, which while very good in the early game comes at the cost of losing power over time, or unyielding and mercantile, which greatly benefit some playstyles while not being particularly helpful for others. Federations also shouldn't be locked behind a tradition, particularly given that most types require an entire second tree to unlock.

Other minor changes I would love to see are a removal of the hard cap on leader level, which right now only really serves to punish traditions like domination and discovery, which could become more competitive with the added bonus and further encourage keeping leaders alive and building narratives around them. Robot suicide should also be removed, it's just mean. Being able to take the first level in all three ascension paths would also be a fun way to create a unique empire that doesn't embrace any one path. It would also be nice if machine intelligences got access to some custom traits with their extra modification points, the way hive minds still have access the biological ascension traits.

Overall, I would just prefer if traditions and ascension didn't feel like ticking off the 4-5 mandatory boxes in the most preferential order for one of three preexisting builds. If there were 15 or so paths, and particularly if some were mutually exclusive, build diversity and real decision making would massively increase. Imagine if you had to choose between military and economic paths and couldn't combine prosperity with supremacy, but could combine it with unyielding or subterfuge. Likewise, you could have expansion and discovery represent different approaches to claiming space, one focused on moving wide and quickly, the other on uncovering secrets and staying tall, but leaving no stone unturned. In the early game you would have to choose between expanding out and taking space as quickly as possible and guaranteeing the space you take is valuable. No flat research speed bonuses, but instead go back to increased anomaly discovery chance and even increased dig site discovery, add on the planetary prospecting decision from adaptability and you have a whole new build centered around maximizing every world you have - would work even better with something like your hydrocentric build or a one-planet challenge.

Besides Origins and Ascension Perks, having them locked behind Ethics would be interesting. Like having Pacifists not having access to Supremacy, and Militarists not having access to an equivalent tree like 'Humility' granting powerful non-violence boosts. Or Egalitarian not getting Domination, and Authoritarian not having access to a new counterpart to that, like 'Coexistence' or something like that.
This could get curious when ethics shift, but there are two ways of handling that. Either you make such traditions mutually exclusive, or you embrace grabbing opposite trees to make shifting ethics a far more compelling mechanic to manage.

As of making smaller weapons better, one probably has to change the Emergency Jump-mechanics, perhaps moving away of rolling every time a ship gets hit to perhaps a daily check in-battle. That would make high-damage long-reload weapons less valuable if they don't destroy the target completely, and might reduce the amount of rolls in a fight.

I would like to have some kind of mercenary empire, maybe a mercenary Megacorp, where you could make a contract with an empire and then when they go to war they can call you as allies and your payment would be based on your war participation. So you would fight the wars yourself and not pay ships worth 50 fleet size and then get some resources at some point.

 Because personally I think the new mercenary enclaves are rather boring, you make a fleet build that thing with the fleet and at some point you receive a message where you get 5000 minerals or so. It's really more like trading a few ships for regularly getting some minerals or food or when you're lucky a bit of science. It really should be more special and exciting.

They could solve a ton of these alpha strike issues if accuracy/evasion was tied to range. You should have a negligible chance to hit at max range, increasing steadily until tracking becomes the limiting factor.

My thought is to boost the role-play factor - expand admirals and generals to a more broad category like 'space forces' and 'terrestrial forces'. The Space Force would include the original admirals and add commander/captain and fighter pilot. Like DS9 and Babylon 5 taught us - a station is only as good as the commander; likewise for Star Trek. Expanding on that might include specialists slots on space stations for scientists and administrators to add flavor and bonuses. Same goes for the Terrestrial Force - generals, but also individual army commanders and exceptional soldiers to fight the bugs like Lt. Rico. 

Once you have named, non-generic personnel among your forces, I think they become more valuable than cannon fodder. On one hand we have the grand sweep of history measured by ships and tech and unity and production, and on the other hand, that grand sweep is punctuated by exceptional individuals who seemingly single-handedly change whole societies.

Personally, I don't think relics should be balanced. I do think you should be able to trade relics, as well as let each federation members receive small buffs from them instead.

Having to decide whether or not you want to pivot, based on an extremely powerful relic you found; or deciding to trade it for a huge sum of resources to another empire, or allowing your federation to protect it... Would feel better than every relic being fairly viable for every build to me.

6:20 I cannot believe he forgot to mention this! Not only does it have that effect but it also has the lowest cooldown of any relic! All other relics take 3600 days to cool down while the war forge takes only 900 days between use. That is a massive difference! Especially for an empire that is floating a ton of minerals at any given time.

I personally want to see Paradox actually care about ship and weapon balance.  I want more ship sections and I want them to reactivate the disabled ship sections in the files.   Once the files are open it takes someone like me who can barely code around 30 seconds to buff point defense weapons.  The fact the Paradox hasn't done anything show how much they care.

For combat reballance for smaller ship, add in a stealth system to get in range to bear arm.
Or build them to be able to get a suprise/flanking bonus if certain system or condintions too.
And for making aa more effective, affected missle's and figthers should get debuffed for a short duration. But that would be hard to ballance rigth to prevent expliots.

But yea overall figths should last a while and if able, current combat is way to fast and stale with optimal first strike builds.
Combat on avarge ends faster then a corvette build timer...

And a new concept for starbases, why dont we have any mines of any sorts?
Between combat stealth for smaller ships, more viable aa and mined fortress systems, you really could invest choke systems.
You would need something to deal with jumps drives and catapult fleets though.

Lastly with combat time extensions, what if ships also get a logistical factor added to spend during combat?
You keep ship upkeep but reduce it in favor of logistical warchest you gotta maintain and possible ship around.

I think one fix for the combat is a form of ECM. So at long range you get an accuracy debuff and at close range ECM is ineffective so you hit more reliably.

So short range weapons actually DO something useful while long range weapons still can sit back and support ships even if they close to close range.


If not that. Proton launchers need a 5 fold increase in rate of fire, (Stop screaming please lemme finish) without changing their DPS.
This removes their alpha strike but retains their damage output and thus utility, but allow hostiles more chances to disengage, possibly making plasma weapons better at making ships actually explode.

My concern about the changes since Federation is the single player game play seems to be more forced to designer intention rather than finding advantages in the emergent behaviour of AI/game systems.  So I find recent runs force more military and less diplo.  An example is fleet boosting influence needed for expansion.  The intelligence system and resource focus is anti-trade, pacts cost too much.
Another example prior to 3.0 you could make en credits by market trading and cause trouble for empires by price manipulation.
They've gone in the "comfort" direction for MP play, strategic resource production is greater.
The reduction in volatility and domestic production makes for boring stability.
I've been in late early game positions where my economy was so strong, I just had nothing to spend it on, apart from fleet expansion and aggressive military adventurism.  Sending almost all the fleet on a galactic journey to exploit warring fan purifier was the only option to create a peaceful option forming a trade federation with a friendly near neighbour.
The wars are usually tedious defeating the AI in detail by coordinating 2+ fleets.

Really like your take on megacorp having the possibility to dominate through branch offices. I anyway would love to see more alternative ways to dominate the galaxy to simply another war. Your idea could also be further developed to introduce a religious system where religious empires could unlock with an ascencion perk to snatch an enimies planet with enough unity and religious pops on the planet, or at least get the chance to roll a dice for it. Countermeasure buildings and edicts for the other side. Or a peacekeeper tradition where you unlock the ability as xenophile peacelovers with enough diplomatic influence on an empire, maybe through their factions, to force them to end their wars prematurely and furthermore get them into an alliance althoug their leader doesn't want to. Espionage should get the possibilty to create deserter fleets (like in other paradox games flleetloyalty maybe), sabotage fleets, a better way to stir up rebellions in enemy territories, steal important tech which you might not have unlocked yet. Tech in total should be a bit more tradeable, sell some weapon schematics to the enemy of my enemy or buy them myself cause i didn't invest in that tech until then. They can be very expensive to balance things out. It would at least be an option to not make science the only way to keep up with the others and give rise to Krogans having nukes.

Also really looking forward to how they'll rebalance ship combat.

"Accept some concurrency issues" doesn't work. I don't see what kind of concurrency issue there are that, for an end user, would be acceptable. Conurrency issues are unpredictable program behaviour,  incorrect or corrupted data, crashes or security exploits. If you don't get concurrency right you have no idea anymore what your program is going to do once it runs.

For traditions, I think hive, robot, and megacorps need at least one unique tradition, preferably two for variety and flavor. Rebalance traditions like Expansion so it helps during the entire game, not just at the beginning and then dead.

The obvious call for ground combat if not rework, then some sort of visualization like scenes of the two sides fighting, correctly using the what troops each side brought so you could see an image of Xenomorphs leaping into a walking wall of reanimated zombie armies.

Gate at least one new tradition behind each ascension like Montu suggested.

For naval combat, missiles still need a niche to fill. I've been suggesting for years that once you discover some sort of jump drive, missiles should be able to make micro jumps to evade PD, fighters, etc.

I think something that might be neat is constructing temporary structures near hyperlanes, wormholes, and more that launch a saturation of space torpedoes or missiles that travel to the next start system and let you saturate enemy defenses and fleets with hundreds of torpedoes or missiles, or at least act as decoys for your own fighters and the like. Anything to make missiles relevant. Even if it's something like a missile detonates when intercepted and does some AOE damage. An antimatter nuclear weapon exploding near-ish fighters, corvettes, destroyers are at least going to rattle the crew somewhat.

Get rid of Neutron Launchers or give them a solid counter. An weapon that does that much damage with zero travel time is exactly what's wrong with the alpha striking issue. At least X slot weapons and Kinetic Arty have the ability to miss.

An actual proper carrier type ship wouldn't be amiss either. Carriers and corvettes could be very powerful with their speed combined with engagement distances, at least for hit and run. Or carriers and destroyers.

Mixed fleet types is something I always do. I usually end up defeating the pure battleship or pure destroyer fleets. PD is underrated, especially by those who rely too much on carriers. And BBs can't hit the small stuff. So I lose some BBs to alpha strikes but they lose all their BBs to corvettes and fighters. Plasma is just fecking brutal and fighters ignore shields/armor.

More stages to megastructures. Let a Dyson sphere start out as an experimental small Dyson swarm fairly early in the game and let it upgrade over the span of the game into the all powerful Dyson sphere. Might feel more meaningful and lets the megastructure's hold onto some of their 'awe inspiring' potential if we've been messing with their infant versions for decades.

More midgame megastructures are welcome, Orbital Rings have become an addiction for me.

Giving psionics more end game power via tradition makes the snowball effect unpredictability more powerful. Synths and biologic powers already start later, so they're already behind the curve, and a tradition tree will still provide benefits from the moment it's chosen. Letting them start with a bigger snowball is a dangerous game

I would like to see Zarqlan's head be a variable relic. As in the size of the Fallen Empire fleet you get depends on what game stage you are in (early, mid, late) and how many holy worlds you colonized. With the size of the fleet you get increasing in the mid and late game, but the size of the fleet you get decreases depending on what percentage of holy worlds you have colonized. Meaning that a late-game activation of the relic with zero holy worlds colonized would net a 50k fallen empire fleet (basically a standard full-sized FE fleet), whereas an early game activation with all the holy worlds colonized would only net you a 2k fleet (basically a single battlecruiser or a couple escorts).

The size could also be influenced by your ethics. Fanatic spiritualist could get a 50% size bonus, while machine empires (excluding servitors), fanatic materialist or synthetically ascended empires get a -50% size penalty (with genocidal empires getting a -75%, and determined exterminators getting a -95%). Rouge servitors and organic empires without special ethics do not get bonuses/penalties either way.

I would also like to see relics pertaining to the other Fallen Empires (a lost archive for materialists, the omnicodex could be repurposed for kissing up to the xenophiles, and you could at least make the xenophobes not hate you by finding the tomb of their founder or something). Though the head of Zarqlan could remain the most powerful FE relic if that is done as the Spiritualists are kinda the most batshit insane FE, which also makes them the most fun.

I really hope either a new expansion or update reworks how armies operate. Maybe implement a way to board enemy vessels with armies so if you focus on rushing army strength and such, you could intercept large armadas and destroy them from the inside.

Also, making espionage give bonuses to combat would be pretty cool, maybe a way to learn weak points in the enemy's ship designs that give you some different buffs to specific empires.

Imo point defense weapons should make up %5 of the weapon lawout of an entire fleet. It's the sweetspot. In your previous tests you clashed monofleet vs monofleet with different weapon layouts.

If you test 95 arty DDs + 5 pd DDs against 20 hangar BBs and compare the results with 100 arty DDs straight vs 20 hangar BBs, it should look way different than your previous tests.

"Tiers" for the tradition trees. Just tack on new tiers whenever you finish all of your slotted trees, maybe add some different branches to further specialize them. Unyielding Defence might branch into some kind of guerilla tree as compared to a fortress tree, or supremacy might go into land/naval warfare, if the former ever gets an update. Stuff like that. I want to have more use for unity once I finish all my traditions, for however I use it, I just would like better uses.

in all honesty there are some tradtion perks heck even civics that are just pointless and work better as a tradtion or other minor thing. However... locking tradtions behind acenion perks is just redudent. With only 8 of either you would essentioally just go, hey! you locked out of two slots now. it makes more sense to have tradtions be soft locked to a combination og goverment type, ethichs, and civics. which could also be a bit much.

I've always been surprised that not even lithoids get a bonus of any sort, when they find either the burrowing space-rock worms or the mineral-finders on a planet...maybe that could give a little bonus to science or society  --  *or* opening a path to the lithoid version of gene engineering (maybe the space-rock worms give the option for greater tolerance of being spaced...which would come in handy if ground troops or leaders get  their spaceships blasted open in a battle)

Well how about new tradition trees for Fanatic Ethos? If anything deserved a boost, it'd be those. I think having more of a cost/benefit as such would be good. Like maybe they replace some of the standard tradition trees (or maybe require the basic tree to unlock the more 'advanced' tree) with larger benefits, but perhaps costs as such to those. Like take Domination, instead maybe you'd gain/replace it with Imperium. Which could provide larger bonuses than the basic one, but at the cost of making you far less likely to make friends (perhaps a reduction in diplomatic weight, and a pretty significant want) in all aspects EXCEPT in regards to say, making vassals. 

I also think that unique trees for some origins (especially more underpowered origins) could allow for further specialization and maybe a bit more storytelling. Like Remnants as an example, could have something like "Ancient Power", which boosts a lot of things, but only super-early on, while providing some smaller bonuses in the long term. Maybe as such too you have a slight bonus to diplomacy, but only with Fallen Empires who might have this due to 'knowing' your empire before your own fall.

if synthetic ascension gets traditions, would be interesting choosing between becoming full synth and staying cibernetic, like the clone origin has, each one having a different buff and debuff, like when full synth having penalties for bio, and cibernetics having a mix of traits with the robotic traits, but not all of them so that it could be "fair". That don't stop the idea of them having kind of a mixed trait like: mass production helping with their "growth" by making the roboticist being able to *only* make cybernetic/robotic pops, it could still have some interactions with the spiritualists, negative ones, of course.

How about one or two new ship classes dedicated to cyber/electronic warfare?  Instead of being weapons-focused like every other class, these ships provide fleet-wide offensive/defensive modifiers (shorter/longer weapon cooldowns; improved/degraded chance to hit; improved PDCs and flak; etc.)  These modifiers could get buffs through the subterfuge tradition tree which could make it worth taking.  

As far as fleet size, make the ships 6 and 12, respectively.  The size 12 ships could even have a module for new X-slot-like cyber/electronic super weapons with long cooldowns.  If you want to reduce an opponent's first strike, use the "X"-slot weapon that reduces weapon range by 20% (or 35 % with subterfuge tradition).

In response to 11:40 that got me thinking.
What if we got forked ascension paths?
Two flesh-is-weak, two mind-over-matter and two genetic-mastery perks which are mutually exclusive.

Perhaps a perk where insted of heading toward fully artificial bodie, the citizenry push to blur the line between their meatspace and cyberspace, with further increases to jobs, reductions to amenities and CG usage weighted against larger sprawl.

A telepathic perk that sees your empire become more mentally homogenous... a little hive minded even.
A step closer to hive minds like synthetic Asc is a step closer to AI, where your people become significantly more ordered into social castes and happier to be placed in lower positions. An authoritarian's dream and the best part is they did it all by themselves.

For an alternative genetic path I'm not sure what the theme could be, but what about instead of unlocking a few more genetic points and some advanced positive genes, we gained significantly more points and unlocked advanced balanced genes (somewhat negative, but optimised toward a goal)?

For concurrency, what you may be able to do with Stellaris depends on how dependant each ticks calculations are on the previous tick. Because for resource calculation, each day/month does a set amount of calculations in one go.

Say going from day A to day B. Currently the resource stores calculation may happen and then it may calculate pop resettlement. Now, if pop resettlement doesn't need to know what the value in day B will be for the resource stores, and if resource store calculation doesn't need to know where the pops are on day B, then it do those calculations concurrently using a snapshot of the values at day A. Likewise, Empire X's planets may not need to consider population location on Empire Y's planets so they can do those calculations concurrently.

The tricky part is identifying the parts that don't depend on each other, splitting them out and then merging them back together after the calculations in a way that does not conflict and isn't slower than just doing the sequential calculations (since threading comes with overhead). Mutation is the devil for concurrency, and traditional games programming mutates a lot. It's a paradigm shift to switch to a more immutable-oriented approach that lends itself well to concurrency.

It could be cool if locking a Tradition behind an origin meant it'd be a tradition that directly involves your origin in some way. Maybe something like being able to go down a tradition tree to unlock extra interactions in the Here Be Dragons origin. Could let them create origins that have a greater effect on the Late Game, with the caveat that you have to spend a whole Tradition tree to unlock that 'ascended origin' functionality.

Coming as a software developer on a real time system - a lot of the core components even built from the ground up could never be multithreaded usefully. Given a CPU with sufficient cores you definitely could but there is a cost to uses more threads so if those threads do not allow significant calculation offloading it wouldnt help.

F.e. Its theoretically possible to make every single system/planet run as its own thread without meaningful concurrency issues. However even a small galaxy of 400 systems would blow out all but the CPUs used by huge server farms thread numbers and would probably slow the game down since it would cause a lot of context switches to handle those threads. 

Realistically a computer the average gamers using is 2-8 threaded and with apps like discord/internet browsers/os functionality/steam/etc there are already multiple processes consuming thread time. The call for "more multicore" support in gaming is pretty much nonsense. Realistically with how many processes an average end user uses I suspect any engine - even brand new - would have devastating concurrency issues with more than 8 threads running at a time.

On paper running up to 8 threads sounds like a huge win, but again, realistically what can you off thread? You can probably have all the resources on a thread just fine, all the combat on another, maybe even all the ai on another.  Sounds like a huge win right? 

Well, not really combat is so rare that it would have negligible impact. AI is probably already threaded if paradox is smart since AI pretty much needs to run constantly for any decent behaviour. Similarly if resources are mot already the main thing on their thread i would be surprised - with a basic estimate of 500 pops * 15 empires across say 200 planets by mid game both producing and consuming resources; that is a reasonable amount of math to keep upto date if you want to do it super fast. 

There is really no point in solving resource concurrency issues unless they want to go hard and make every system or every empire its own thread, but my intuition says that would actually make it slower on your standard recommend specs PC from excessive context switches. Even 16 AI empires is 2-4 times the threads of a "normal" cpu. 32 starting empires + 4 fallen empires puts a conservative 36 separate threads which is more than double the best consumer CPUs (8 core hyperthreaded) you might reasonably expect someone to use. I cannot say the exact cost benefit here, but generally two processes on a single thread CPU are slower than one process no matter how the work is split up.

Tl:dr on standard consumer computers i doubt paradox could do much more threading even with a brand new engine than AI | resources | combat. If they want to crank up their min specs they coupd start breaking AIs into more threads easily enough (also gives the benefit of more cpu cycles for AI). Breaking up resources usefully would require too many threads to probably be worth it.

I'm a site engineer and today two of my sites were an hour apart so on the long dull drive I daydreamed and I came up with a neat idea that almost certainly won't get used. 

Countermeasures.

A countermeasure negates 1 shot be it a neutron launcher or an autocannon. Every ship has a number of countermeasures equal to its naval command cost (corvettes 1, titians 16) plus 1/2/3 per S/M/L armour module. A 1 armour corvette will have 2 countermeasures, a full shield battleship will have 8 and a full armour cruiser will have 20! Shields would still be useful just because they're still cheaper for the same "health" and they regen.

These would be very detrimental to large slow fire standoff weapons but weak vs small fast firing weapons. So an arty BB would be weak to an all armour cruiser (so many countermeasures and decent sized guns), but that'd be weak vs shielded laser corvettes (blows through the countermeasures and good vs armour) which would be weak against gunboat shield destroyers (destroyers just kill corvettes well) which would be weak against the before mentioned arty BBs (heavy shield destroyers lack countermeasures). 

So if you'd get a mixed fleet you would, over a prolonged fight, be able to burn through all the enemy's countermeasures much faster than a pure arty BB spam fleet; so even though you have fewer arty BBs in a mixed fleet they will be doing damage with their big guns WAY before a pure arty BB spam gets through all the mixed fleets countermeasures.

I would highly suggest a Trade system upgrade some suggestions: 1. Asking for resources trades on a galactic scale.
2. Having trades behave like Civ trading, where you could ask for resources and see what the A.I would want in return. And of course counter suggestions for trades.
3. Being capable of demanding (one time bundle) resources in exchange for a non-aggression pact.
4. Actually trading systems with A.I's.

It would be great to also add about 60-80 new technologies.
I'm against the idea of giving species packs Achievements it would make getting all the species packs necessary... Which would suck imo. 🖋️

Honestly, the biggest thing I want for the future of the game is to decrease the gatekeeping on unique technologies. Perhaps add that to the espionage system? Try to steal some blueprints from an empire that killed a dragon to get the tier 6 armor blueprint, steal dark matter tech from a fallen empire, etc. I understand that a lot of this is essentially a reward for fighting whatever guards the tech, but it just isn't fun being at an inescapable disadvantage to other empires, especially other player empires, because you didn't have a dragon anywhere close to your space, or because you have been focusing on something other than military.

My concern with making Traditions tied to an Origin or Ascension - they become build taxes. Meaning that it just becomes something you have to take to go down a certain path, rather than a choice that can lead to different playstyles.

I would rather Tradition trees become just that - TREES, where you pick a branch that you work down, excluding other options. That way, you have true choices rather than just picking the different order you gather everything.

Jumping down here to endorse the idea of traditions relating to some origins/civics.  Something to really elevate those fun niche playthroughs.  Part of it's spawn luck (my nearest neighbor is somehow always a fanatical purifier) but I can't say I've ever had a megacorp playthrough that actually felt FUN. Hell, perhaps replace the all but required ASCENSION perk for Ocean Paradise empires with a tradition tree.

Look, I am 100% down for an Espionage rework. I am finally enjoying that since I bought Nemesis, but it's very thin and simple mechanics with kinda weak operations for the most part. I mainly beeline full intel so I can see what my neighbors are doing, and gathering assets occasionally just to say i did.

What I REALLY want a redesign of is the Ground Combat/Armies system. Given the team's refocus on planetary-level development with Orbital Rings in Overlord (the monstrous unit from the Delving Too Deep event chain, overlord garrisons, etc), I wouldn't mind seeing some ground-space artillery armies for defense forces, maybe a more tactical mini-game for ground invasions, and even building composite armies from ground troops, mechanical cav, air support and "weird" units, the same way we take multiple ships and turn them into larger legions or something. Also being able to embed armies in existing fleets seems LONG overdue - give me the option to embed a few WarForms in my fleet so that they can be dropped from orbit after bombardment, instead of being a tag-along fleet for cleanup.

Ultimately, I want ground invasions and defenses to be more than an afterthought - make invasion/defense more of its own mini-game and then have some unit diversification for ground/cav/air/navy etc - with marines able to be embedded in regular military ships so we don't need to babysit helpless transport fleets around.
